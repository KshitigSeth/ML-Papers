# Machine Learning Papers

This repository compiles my notes and summaries (plus reproductions, where possible) of influential Machine Learning research papers Iâ€™ve read â€”  
[and some not-so-influential ones that I just find interesting.]

## Papers Added So Far

| No. | Title | Author(s) | Folder |

## Structure

Each paper gets its own folder with:
- `summary.md`: Core insights, explanations, and thoughts
- Code files (if applicable): Reproductions or related experiments

## Purpose

This repo helps me:
- Solidify understanding by writing summaries
- Build an ML intuition across diverse subfields
- Create a reference I can revisit and extend over time
