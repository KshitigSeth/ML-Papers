# Machine Learning Papers

This repository compiles my notes and summaries (plus reproductions, where possible) of influential Machine Learning research papers I’ve read —  
[and some not-so-influential ones that I just find interesting.]

## Structure

Each paper gets its own folder with:
- `summary.md`: Core insights, explanations, and thoughts
- Code files (if applicable): Reproductions or related experiments

Note: Gen AI has been used in some parts of the summary files to convert my notes into a well structured and formatted markdown file, and to contextualize some findings.

## Purpose

This repo helps me:
- Solidify understanding by writing summaries
- Build an ML intuition across diverse subfields
- Create a reference I can revisit and extend over time
