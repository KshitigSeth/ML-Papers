Pedro Domingos shares 12 key insights that constitute the “folk knowledge” of machine learning. These are meant to be foundational and practical insight that are often missed in textbooks. The paper covers pitfalls to avoid, principles to prioritize, and subtle phenomena encountered in ML.

This was a great paper to start with on this plan to dive deeper into Machine Learning via literature. Here are the key points covered:

---

## 1. Learning = Representation + Evaluation + Optimization
- ML algorithms combine these 3 components.
- Most textbooks emphasize representation, but evaluation and optimization are equally critical.
- Hypothesis space depends on the choice of representation.

## 2. It’s Generalization that Counts
- The goal is generalization, not memorization.
- Always separate training and test data (e.g., cross-validation).
- Avoid “test data contamination” when tuning hyperparameters.

## 3. Data Alone Is Not Enough
- Learners need prior assumptions to generalize.
- “No Free Lunch” theorem: generalization requires inductive biases.

## 4. Overfitting Has Many Faces
- Overfitting = hallucinating patterns not present in reality.
- Bias-variance tradeoff: high bias = systematic error, high variance = noise sensitivity.
- Solutions: regularization, statistical tests, model complexity control.
- Beware of overusing cross-validation and multiple testing.

## 5. Intuition Fails in High Dimensions
- Curse of dimensionality makes generalization harder.
- Nearest neighbors and similarity break down in high dimensions.
- Blessing of non-uniformity: data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds.

## 6. Theoretical Guarantees Are Not What They Seem
- PAC-style guarantees often require impractically large datasets.
- Asymptotic guarantees are rarely relevant in real-world settings.
- Use theory to inspire design, not to pick algorithms blindly.

## 7. Feature Engineering Is the Key
- Often the most labor-intensive and creative part.
- Good features simplify the learning problem.
- Automated feature generation is promising but limited.

## 8. More Data Beats a Cleverer Algorithm
- A simple model with more data often outperforms a complex one with less.
- Currently, time, not data, is often the bottleneck.
- Simpler models scale better.

## 9. Learn Many Models, Not Just One
- Ensembles (bagging, boosting, stacking) improve accuracy by combining models.
- Bayesian model averaging is theoretically elegant but rarely practical.

## 10. Simplicity Does Not Imply Accuracy
- Occam’s Razor is useful but not a universal rule.
- More complex models can generalize better in many cases.

## 11. Representable Does Not Imply Learnable
- Just because a function can be expressed doesn't mean it can be learned.
- Learnability depends on search procedure, data, and representation.

## 12. Correlation Does Not Imply Causation
- ML learns associations, not causality.
- Observational data is limited in extracting causal relationships.

**Conclusion**:  
ML success often comes from good heuristics, domain insight, and smart feature design-not just from the algorithm. This is often overlooked and extremely important to know before diving into the field, and this paper helps ground the ML journey in practical wisdom.
